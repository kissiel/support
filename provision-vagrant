# Helper script to provision vagrant image 
# ========================================

# Set CHECKBOX_TOP for all shared scripts
export CHECKBOX_TOP=/vagrant 

# Make sure that dpkg never stops to have a chat with the user
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Add any necessary PPA repositories
$CHECKBOX_TOP/support/install-ppa-dependencies

# Update to have the latest packages, this is needed because the image comes
# with an old (and no longer working) apt cache and links to many packages no
# longer work. This is also needed if the step above actually added any PPAs.
apt-get update

# Update all packages to latest version
# NOTE: this is disabled as it takes a lot of time and we haven't found the
# need to run this. It might have to be re-enabled later if we find that some
# bug (that gets fixed) is affecting our behavior but so far that has not been
# the case.
# apt-get dist-upgrade --yes
