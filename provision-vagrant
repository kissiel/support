# On various installations of Ubuntu this is not the case as the cloud images
# we depend on seem to have broken virtualbox tools installation inside.  This

# processes attempting to use it.

E: See this link for a workaround if you have recent-enough VirtualBox:

E: Alternatively you can use NFS on any version of VirtualBox:
